# MAUT-Decision-Support-System (OCTAVE/MATLAB)
Multi-Attribute Utility Theore (MAUT) method for a DSS about e-batteries for vehicles. We are having 15 experts &amp; 3 criteria to evaluate (cost, performance, credibility). Alternatives are lithium, nickel, hydrogen batteries. I am using pairwise comparison matrix and the CR  &lt; 0.1. Also, doing a Monte Carlo simulation for sensitivity analysis.

In order to run it: you just can download Octave or use the Online IDE https://octave-online.net/.
Just run the MAUT_F.m file and the maut_sensitivity_f.m file for the sensitivity analysis test.
